This repository has MATLAB package for linear and nonlinear optimization,
implemented by me based on Simplex method and Newton method; 

For Linear programming, the function mylinprog(A,b,c): 
           minimize        c'*x,
          subject to     A*x >= b, x >= b

For Nonlinear part, the function myzerofinder(F) computes the root of
the equation F(x) = 0; the function unconopt(f,x0) calculates the local
minimizer of f around moving from x0.

More details are inside m-files.
